They're also a good source of copper, magnesium, and manganese - nutrients important for energy production, brain health, immunity, and bone health.\n\nCashew kernels are graded on the basis of their size, shape, colour. A grade is denoted by an alphabet and a number. For eg: W 320 would mean whole 320. The number 320 signifies how many kernels are there in 1 pound (454 grams) of cashew. That's how you get grades like W210, W240, W320, etc.\n\nBelow are some of the grades of whole kernels:\n- W-180: 'King of Cashew', they are larger in size and very expensive.\n- W-210: Are popularly known as 'Jumbo' nuts.\n- W-240: It is an attractive grade which is reasonably priced.\n- W-320: Are the most popular among cashew kernels and highest in terms of availability, worldwide.\n- W-450: Are the smallest and cheapest whole kernels and hence the favourite among low priced whole grades.\n",

They're also a good source of copper, magnesium, and manganese - nutrients important for energy production, brain health, immunity, and bone health.\n\nCashew kernels are graded on the basis of their size, shape, colour. A grade is denoted by an alphabet and a number. For eg: W 210 would mean whole 210. The number 210 signifies how many kernels are there in 1 pound (454 grams) of cashew. That's how you get grades like W210, W240, W320, etc.\n\nBelow are some of the grades of whole kernels:\n- W-180: 'King of Cashew', they are larger in size and very expensive.\n- W-210: Are popularly known as 'Jumbo' nuts.\n- W-240: It is an attractive grade which is reasonably priced.\n- W-320: Are the most popular among cashew kernels and highest in terms of availability, worldwide.\n- W-450: Are the smallest and cheapest whole kernels and hence the favourite among low priced whole grades.\n",

        "Description": "Overview:Mahafruit golden seedless raisins are produced from selected Thompson seedless variety of grapes. Raisins are an excellent source of fiber, iron and also calcium. Raisins are also good for the eyes and help to prevent muscular degeneration.Key FeaturesNatural Golden ColorCholesterol FreeChemical residue freeGood for immune systemGood Agricultural PracticesIngredientsGolden RaisinsCare InstructionsMust keep it airtight & refrigerated for optimum freshnessAny Other Must-Know Information Constipation:When ingested, raisins swell because the fiber present in them has shrunk in a raisin\u0092s dried form, but it will begin to swell due to the body\u0092s natural fluids. This adds bulk to the food moving through the intestinal tract and ultimately helps provide relief from constipation. The type of fiber in raisins is considered insoluble fiber because it takes in water and gains volume in that way.  Weight Gain:Raisins, like all dried fruits, are very good tools for gaining weight in a healthy way, since they are full of fructose and glucose and contain a lot of potential energy. They form an ideal part of a diet for athletes or bodybuilders who need powerful boosts of energy, or for those who want to put on weight without accumulating unhealthy amounts of cholesterol. Cancer Prevention:Raisins have high levels of the catechist, which are polyphenolic antioxidants in the blood. Antioxidants scavenge the free radicals that float around the body and wreak havoc on the organ systems and cells. Free radicals are one of the primary, underlying factors that lead to the spontaneous growth of cancer cells, as well as the substance that can spur on metastasis. Therefore, by including raisins in your diet and increasing the level of these powerful antioxidants in your system, you can prevent cancer from forming, or slow down its progress if you have already developed a number of forms of that deadly disease. Hypertension:For many years, some people have believed that raisins have the power to reduce blood pressure and protect the integrity of heart health, but it was only recently that experts began intensive studies on these claims. The findings, although still not absolutely definitive on how raisins reduced blood pressure, did show a positive correlation between reduced hypertension and consumption of raisins. Many of the nutrients packed into raisins are beneficial, but experts believe that it is the high level of potassium that helps with this condition. Potassium is a well-researched way to reduce the tension of blood vessels and decrease blood pressure, and the dietary fiber in raisins is also thought to affect the biochemistry of blood vessels and reduce their stiffness, which in turn reduces hypertension. Diabetes:In a number of studies, raisins have been shown to lower the postprandial insulin response, which means that after eating a meal, they can help the spikes or plunges in insulin levels that can be so dangerous to patients with diabetes. It modulates the sugar absorption by the body, making it more even and stable, reducing the chance of health complications or emergencies for those suffering from both major types of diabetes. They also help to regulate the release of leptin and ghrelin, which are the hormones responsible for telling the body when it is hungry or full. By keeping these hormones in check, people who eat raisins can improve their chances of maintaining a healthy diet and prevent overeating, which further improves their chances of living comfortably with diabetes!Anemia: Raisins contain a considerable amount of iron which directly helps in the treatment of anaemia. It also contains many members of the vitamin B complex that are essential for the formation of new blood. The high copper content in raisins also helps the formation of red blood cells. Fever: Phenolic Phytonutrients, well known for their germicidal, antibiotic, and antioxidant properties, are abundantly present in raisins and can help cure fevers by fighting viral and bacterial infections. Eye Care:Raisins contain polyphenolic phytonutrients which have antioxidant properties. These phytonutrients are very good for ocular health, as they protect the eyes from the damage caused by free radicals (oxidants), in the form of muscular degeneration, age-related weakening of vision, and cataracts. In addition to their antioxidant qualities, raisins contain significant amounts of vitamin A, A-Beta Carotene, and A-Carotenoid, all of which are essential for good ocular health. Bone Health: Calcium, which is the main element of our bones, is present in raisins, and these dried fruits are also one of the best sources of Boron, a micro-nutrient. For those of you who don\u0092t know, a micronutrient is a nutrient required by the body in a very small amount as compared to other nutrients that must be consumed daily in significant amounts. Boron is vital for proper bone formation and efficient absorption of calcium. Boron is particularly helpful in preventing osteoporosis induced by menopause in women and has been shown to be very beneficial for bones and joints. Potassium is another essential nutrient found in high levels in raisins which can help strengthen bones and promote bone growth, thereby reducing the chances of osteoporosis in all types of people. Dental Care: Oleanolic Acid, one of the phytochemicals present in raisins, plays a crucial role in protecting your teeth against tooth decay, cavities, and teeth brittleness. It effectively prevents the growth of Streptococcus Mutans and Porphyromonas Gingivalis, two of the bacterial species that are most responsible for cavities and other dental problems. In addition, it is rich in calcium which is good for promoting dental health, as it prevents breaking or peeling away of teeth and enamel while making them stronger. In addition to its role in bone health and osteoporosis treatment, the boron present in raisins plays a very important role in curbing the growth of oral germs as well as in promoting strong teeth. Other Benefits: The fibers in raisins also help promote the excretion of bile from the body, and it stimulates the burning of cholesterol, thereby promoting good cardiac health. Furthermore, the amount of fiber in them helps to literally sweep out the toxins and harmful materials in the digestive tract, which can protect people from additional intestinal diseases, and bacterial growth that is eliminated when the toxins are swept out.About the BrandChandrakranti Farms, having more than two decades of experience in the production and supply of quality fruits and dry fruits.

Is it the same as Bathua?Ans. Quinoa is actually a seed, not a grain, although it is prepared similar to rice. Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) looks like bathua, (Chenopodium album) which is often grown as a vegetable crop for its shoots and leaves, which are prepared similar to spinach. Quinoa is closely related to Bathua, although it's grown more for its highly nutritious seeds. Quinoa was first domesticated by the Andean peoples around 3000 years ago who referred to quinoa as chisaya mama or 'mother of all grains.'2 What is the meaning of Certified Organic?Ans- Certified Organic means you can trust that the food you eat is pure, safe, and toxin-free. Fresh organic produce is grown in rich, clean soil that is abundant in micronutrients, producing full-flavored and better-tasting nutrients foods. Go organic for a happy, healthy & sustainable future for you, your family, and the world. 3 Why is Quinoa so expensive?Ans - Organic India's price is comparable to most quinoa on the market. ORGANIC INDIA quinoa is certified organic, high quality, and ethically produced, establishing a highly nutritious sustainable food crop for us all to benefit from. Farming quinoa organically is very labour-intensive, especially to initiate production. The high standards and quality control measures ensure you receive authentic quality True Wellness products. The current market price for quinoa is high, worldwide, which has made it difficult for the local farmers in South America as it puts traditional dietary staples out of reach for local communities who have relied on their harvest for decades.

For every cup of rice,add 2 1/2 of cups of water and cook it by steaming process under low flamewithout any weight on the cooker. An electric rice cooker is also very ideal for steaming. It takesaround 40-45 minutes by this method. Alternatively soak every cup of washed rice in 1 3/4 of water for 1 hour. Cook this without changing the water in a pressure cooker or on a microwave like you cook your regular rice. Increase the number of whistles to let the rice cook well.Cooked Brown Rice does not retain the grain shape like white rice. Due to pressure the outer bran ruptures and the grain opens along the longer axis. This is a characteristic of Brown Rice. The rice is non-sticky but still soft and chewy. It carries the taste of dals and curries very well.The above is based on a 650 watt microwave.

And Nestl\u00e9 accepted the challenge.Our coffee specialist, Max Morgenthaler, was on a mission to create a delicious cup of coffee simply by adding water. Max and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant coffee that would retain the coffee\u0092s natural flavour. In 1938, they found the answer, and NESCAF\u00c9 was born. Named by using the first three letters in Nestl\u00e9 and suffixing it with \u0091caf\u00e9\u0092, NESCAF\u00c9 became the new name in coffee. Up until the 1960s NESCAF\u00c9 was only available in tins. Then in 1961, they launched our very first glass jar, in Japan. It was a huge success and helped position NESCAF\u00c9 as a premium product. So in 1962, we decided to launch the glass jar in Europe too. This 1930s Swiss newspaper advert played on the speed and ease of making a NESCAF\u00c9. And it worked. NESCAF\u00c9 was an instant success. Never before had making coffee been so convenient, fast and easy. ",

Sometimes, they have it with milk, sometimes rotis and if time and patience allow, they even make sweets out of it. But the best way to go about Aamras is to have it directly as is. The way the ancients intended. Without preservatives or artificial flavour. Without frills or hassles. An honest treat for an honest day\u0092s work.\nA silkesque ale cascading down your throat - Soothing, serenading and more importantly, lingering. To remind you that the mango is indeed the true king of the fruit realm. And that we cannot help but submit to its tasty tyranny.\n\nFunctional Benefits\nBelieve or not, Aamras does have other functional benefits other than tasting like mythical, golden nectar from the heavens. For one thing, it helps prevent heart disease - The Beta-Carotene, Selenium, Potassium and Vitamin-E in the mangoes pretty much ensure that. Being rich in iron and copper, it also helps produce blood corpuscles. In addition to all this, it builds your immune system, aids in digestion, controls blood pressure, prevents anemia, relaxes muscle tissues and occasionally, reminds you of summer vacations.\n",

So, what next? Picture this. Mumbai, the city that never sleeps, had never woken up to the possibility of something other than Potato Chips as a snack. Here is where Mr. Chheda saw his opportunity, and under the name Chheda Wafers, introduced traditional Banana Chips in standardized packaging. This is how the journey began.",

This vapouriser system is powered by Gold Flash technology which has 2 modes - Flash and Normal Mode. Use Flash Mode when there are more mosquitoes, and Normal Mode when there are fewer mosquitoes. Visible powerful Flash vapours instantly spread across the room and drive away mosquitoes, even the hidden ones. Flash mode releases visible vapours for 30 minutes every 4 hours, providing you and your family superior protection against mosquitoes.How To Use- Remove the cap & insert the liquid vaporiser bottle into the specially designed electric heating machine. Plugin & switch on the heater. - For better results close the door & windows for the initial 30 minutes, and open post that. Lightly perfumed vapours will start emitting within a few minutes. - Always place the unit where the evaporated insecticidal ingredients will not escape out. Excessive ventilation in the room reduces efficacy. - Use a standard vaporizing machine that gives a minimum temperature of 135 degrees C to evaporate the repellent.",

They are simply numbers that measure the electrical current used by the vacuums' motor. What you should be looking for instead is the vacuum cleaners' airflow, suction and water lift. They are better indicators of performance.Pack ContentsEureka Super Clean Vacuum Cleaner (800 W) : 1 UnitSpecial Note : Do not use it continuously for more than 10-15 minutes.",

The handle normally could not bear such a high temperature for a long time and at the same time, the oven space is not so big to put the inside along with the handle. So, the detachable handle is the ideal solution. It Could be used as normal handle while cooking on the gas stove and at the same time you can detach the handle from the pan if the pan needs to stay in the oven. Also, you can keep it in a smaller space if you detach the handle from the pan.\n\nPack Contents :\n- Trupti Non-stick Pizza Pan : 1 Unit\n- SS Lid : 1 Unit\n- Detachable Handle : 1 Unit\n",

It was not designed to carry both hot and cold food at the same time.- Tyffyn is especially well suited for moist, dense, hot food. Ideal for all curries, dhal, rice, roti, idli/dosa, biriyani, kebabs, tikkas, rasam rice, chowders, mashed potatoes, lasagna, gnocchi, baked pasta, minestrone, moule, tofu, rice, ratatouille, cream of vegetables, dumplings etc. - Tyffyn is also very suitable for cold food, such as salads, tofu, yogurt, ice cream, fruit, cheese, cold noodles, gazpacho, potato salad, rice salad, cole slaw, deviled eggs, jello, sushi etc.Any Other Must-Know InformationNeither the Tyffyn outer shell, nor the inner containers are designed for use in a microwave oven. Placing them in a microwave oven could seriously damage both them, and the appliance.Benefits- Keeps food fresh and flavourful. - Food remains safe for consumption in stainless steel containers.Care InstructionsWe recommend hand-cleaning your Tyffyn with a mild detergent and a damp cloth. Never soak the base and outer shell, nor place them under running water, these parts are not dishwasher-safe. The inner containers are instead dishwasher safe (up to 60C), or can also be washed by hand. Never scrub your Tyffyn or inner containers. Never use a solvent, or a cleaner containing chlorine, or water with heavy mineral content as this may ruin the finish of your Tyffyn.About the Brand- Local Roots.

Any attempt to recharge a non-rechargeable battery could result in rupture or leakage.Care TipsTips for proper battery care and use - Always use the correct size and type of battery specified by the device manufacturer. - Keep battery contact surfaces and battery compartment contacts clean by rubbing them with a clean pencil eraser or a rough cloth each time you replace batteries. - Remove batteries from a device when it is not expected to be in use for several months and while it is being powered by household (AC) current. - Make sure that you insert batteries into your device properly, with the + (plus) and \u0096 (minus) terminals aligned correctly. CAUTION: Some equipment using more than three batteries may appear to work properly even if one battery is inserted incorrectly. - Do not attempt to recharge a battery unless the battery specifically is marked \u0093rechargeable.\u0094 - Some depleted batteries and batteries that are exposed to extremely high temperatures may leak. A crystalline structure may begin to form on the outside of the battery. - Extreme temperatures reduce battery performance. Store batteries in a dry place at normal room temperature. Do not refrigerate Duracell batteries as this will not make them last longer, and avoid putting battery-powered devices in very warm places.",
