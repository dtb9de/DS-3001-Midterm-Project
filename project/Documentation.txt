Description:
My code uses data from csv/json files, MongoDB, and MySQL
The data initally starts in CSV form but is uploaded to both MongoDB and MySQL
The completed database has 5 tables
 - customers : originating on python/MongoDB, converted from customers.csv
 - products : originating on python/MongoDB, converted from products.csv
 - dim_customers : customers dimension imported with minor changes to variable names and types into MySQL 
 - dim_products : products dimension imported with minor changes to variable names and types into MySQL
 - dim_date : date dimension that utilizes the order_key column from dim_customers but is otherwise the same code from Lab 2 C and Lab 3

Deployment:
To deploy the code, one should run it in this order
1. Start by creating the database 'supermart' in the MySQL file "Supermart_dataset" (code at the top)
2. Next open the MySQL file "supermart_date_dim" and run the entire file
 - When I run it, I get a mySQL lost connection error, but the code still works
3. Then run all the code in the file "supermart mongodb" on jupyter notebooks
4. Next run all the code in the MySQL file "Supermart_dataset"
If run properly the code should successfully create an ETL pipeline for the data from the supermart code
